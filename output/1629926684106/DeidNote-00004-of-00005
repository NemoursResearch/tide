She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  \nI then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.\n  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.","FINDING_note":"[{\"word\":\"Roux\",\"start\":3668,\"end\":3672,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Schwab\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Roux\",\"start\":3475,\"end\":3479,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Feygin\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Roux\",\"start\":2284,\"end\":2288,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Bollinger\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Marcaine\",\"start\":1136,\"end\":1144,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Nooney\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Foley\",\"start\":1003,\"end\":1008,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Ashley\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Delhi\",\"start\":462,\"end\":467,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Union City \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Delhi\",\"start\":462,\"end\":467,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Union City \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Delhi\",\"start\":462,\"end\":467,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Union City \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"25 930 West Winton Ave, Delhi 94545\",\"start\":161,\"end\":196,\"type\":\"location\",\"replacement\":\"856 Tilton Ct, San Jose CA \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-general\"},{\"word\":\"25 930 West Winton Ave, Delhi 94545\",\"start\":161,\"end\":196,\"type\":\"location\",\"replacement\":\"752 Beacon Ln, San Jose CA \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-general\"},{\"word\":\"25 930 West Winton Ave, Delhi 94545\",\"start\":161,\"end\":196,\"type\":\"location\",\"replacement\":\"35 Smith Township State Rd, Burgettstown PA \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-general\"},{\"word\":\"Delhi\",\"start\":185,\"end\":190,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Erlanger \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Delhi\",\"start\":185,\"end\":190,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Erlanger \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Delhi\",\"start\":185,\"end\":190,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Erlanger \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"West Winton Ave\",\"start\":168,\"end\":183,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"San Jose \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"West Winton Ave\",\"start\":168,\"end\":183,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"San Jose \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"West Winton Ave\",\"start\":168,\"end\":183,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"San Jose \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Sapna\",\"start\":143,\"end\":148,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"San Jose \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Sapna\",\"start\":143,\"end\":148,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"San Jose \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Sapna\",\"start\":143,\"end\":148,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"San Jose \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Deepak\",\"start\":131,\"end\":137,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Hitchcock\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Rahul\",\"start\":120,\"end\":125,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Hemingway\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"1/31/2021\",\"start\":85,\"end\":94,\"type\":\"DATE\",\"replacement\":\"01/09/2021\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-date\"},{\"word\":\"Jon\",\"start\":81,\"end\":84,\"type\":\"NAME\",\"replacement\":\"Bryce\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-name-knownNames\"},{\"word\":\"Michell\",\"start\":72,\"end\":79,\"type\":\"NAME\",\"replacement\":\"Firestone\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-name-knownNames\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":56,\"end\":71,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"deidentified@example.com\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":56,\"end\":71,\"type\":\"EMAIL/URL\",\"replacement\":\"deidentified@example.com\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-token\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":56,\"end\":71,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"[general-email]\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":56,\"end\":71,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"[general-email]\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":56,\"end\":71,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"[general-email]\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"}]","TEXT_DEID_note":"THIS IS NOTE SIX (6) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , person_6 deidentified@example.com Firestone, Bryce 01/09/2021 Gurpreet test Ninad test Hemingway test Hitchcock test San Jose  test Mayur -856 Tilton Ct, San Jose CA  Morbid obesity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Morbid obesity.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with EEA anastomosis.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation.,\nINDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , This is a 30-year-old female, Union City  who has been overweight for many years.

She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.

Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  \nThe lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.  This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture.  \nThe patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus.  A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area.  \nA compressive garment was placed.  The patient was then aroused from anesthesia, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Sponge, needle, lap, instrument counts were all correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.  The estimated blood loss was approximately 25 mL.","FINDING_note":"[{\"word\":\"7161 Rimrock Dr, Gwalior 95828\",\"start\":1649,\"end\":1679,\"type\":\"location\",\"replacement\":\"739 Dyer Brook Rd, Dyer Brook ME \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-general\"},{\"word\":\"7161 Rimrock Dr, Gwalior 95828\",\"start\":1649,\"end\":1679,\"type\":\"location\",\"replacement\":\"727 Emily Ct, Livermore CA \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-general\"},{\"word\":\"7161 Rimrock Dr, Gwalior 95828\",\"start\":1649,\"end\":1679,\"type\":\"location\",\"replacement\":\"198 Yucca Ave, San Jose CA \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-general\"},{\"word\":\"Gwalior\",\"start\":1666,\"end\":1673,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Naples \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Gwalior\",\"start\":1666,\"end\":1673,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Naples \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Gwalior\",\"start\":1666,\"end\":1673,\"type\":\"ner-LOCATION\",\"replacement\":\"Naples \",\"foundBy\":\"deid-location-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Deepak Boston Sapna\",\"start\":151,\"end\":170,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Pridgen\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"Rahul\",\"start\":140,\"end\":145,\"type\":\"ner-PERSON\",\"replacement\":\"Soliz\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-person-ner\"},{\"word\":\"1/31/2021\",\"start\":89,\"end\":98,\"type\":\"DATE\",\"replacement\":\"01/09/2021\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-date\"},{\"word\":\"Jon\",\"start\":85,\"end\":88,\"type\":\"NAME\",\"replacement\":\"Sidney\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-name-knownNames\"},{\"word\":\"Michell\",\"start\":76,\"end\":83,\"type\":\"NAME\",\"replacement\":\"Pokharel\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-name-knownNames\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":60,\"end\":75,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"deidentified@example.com\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":60,\"end\":75,\"type\":\"EMAIL/URL\",\"replacement\":\"deidentified@example.com\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-token\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":60,\"end\":75,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"[general-email]\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":60,\"end\":75,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"[general-email]\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"},{\"word\":\"poland@test.net\",\"start\":60,\"end\":75,\"type\":\"general-email\",\"replacement\":\"[general-email]\",\"foundBy\":\"deid-general\"}]","TEXT_DEID_note":"THIS IS NOTE SEVEN (7) PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  person_6 deidentified@example.com Pokharel, Sidney 01/09/2021 test Priya test Gurpreet test Ninad test Soliz test Pridgen test Mayur Mumbai -24 Deformity, right breast reconstruction.,2.

She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , 739 Dyer Brook Rd, Dyer Brook ME  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.
